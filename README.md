This is my old Pacman code and it only works in Python 2.7.  If you want code that works with Python 3, then you can go to pacmancode.com where I'm currently updating that code.  
Run the game with <b>python gamecontrol.py</b>
You also need to have numpy installed for this code to work.  
Pause and unpause the game with the spacebar.
Move Pacman with the arrow keys.
